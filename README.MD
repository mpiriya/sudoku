# Sudoku Solver Project

## What has been done

- correctly finds all possible values in each empty tile of a valid sudoku board

- sorts the tiles in order of ease to solve

- recursively enter values into tiles with possible values of size 1, then update the remaining empty tiles

## Todo:

- implement DFS tree that handles when the min possible values is greater than 1

- add GUI!
