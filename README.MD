# Sudoku Solver Project

## What has been done

- correctly finds all possible values in each empty tile of a valid sudoku board

- sorts the tiles in order of ease to solve

- recursively enter values into tiles with possible values of size 1, then update the remaining empty tiles

- backtracing (backtracking?) algorithm to solve the rest

- GUI

## Todo:

- color

- maybe animations to show how the backtracking works?

- text fields only accept one number

- what to do if there exist multiple solutions? no solution? board entered is invalid?
